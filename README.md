# BattleShip 

**BattleShip Project for Object Oriented Programming Class**

The goal was to develop a Battleship game in Java and add an AI. 

There's three modes available : 
* *Human vs Human*
* *AI vs Humain*
* *AI vs AI*

## You can :

* **Launch the game by running** `falcone.thomas.Battleship`

* **Execute AI test to evaluate the AIs' efficienty by running** `fr.battleship.TestIA` 
(*Note that this will create a .csv file as an output with the results*)

*(To execute both commands you have to launch the bash script `make.sh`)*
